Hello ladies and germs. This is Tim Ferriss  and welcome to another episode of the Tim Ferriss Show where it is my job to deconstruct world class performers whether they are from chess, sports, military, entertainment or otherwise. I tease out the routines, habits, favorite books, etc. that you can use.  At least that is the goal.

And this episode was a massive success because the because the guest Seth Godin 10x-ed my expectations.  And I already expected him to be a incredible, and of course he was. Seth Godin is probably the best known marketing mind in the world. The author of 17 best selling books that have been translated into more than 35 languages.  He writes about the way ideas spread, marketing of course,  strategic quitting, leadership. But most of all challenging the status quo in all areas. And he does this personally in his own life in many different ways.

His books include Linchpin, Tribes, The Dip, Purple Cow, Your Turn, and may others. He's also founded many companies including YoYo Dine and Squido. His blog, which is easy to find, just type "Seth" into Google, is one of the most popular in the world. He has been inducted into the Direct Marketing Hall of Fame.

He's done all sorts of amazing things. And, generally speaking, Seth doesn't get into his personal life, his personal habits. This interview is an exception. he tells a lot of stories he's never told before. we get into a lot of details he has never disclosed  or shared before. and we cover a ton. we had a blast.

His favorite list of all audio books that he listen to repeatedly-- some of them once per month, his morning routine, breakfast, dietary habits, how he processes email, meditative practices. why he's fixated on, among other things, coffee and vodka. despite the fact that he consumes neither of them. how to go from "wantentrepreneur" to entrepreneur. and it goes on and on.  we really had a great time.  I hope you also have a good time listening to it.  so without further ado please enjoy my conversation with, none other than, Seth Godin.

!# Tim @ 4:21

Seth, welcome to the show.

!# Seth @ 4:24

Tim, it's a pleasure.  what a thrill to talk to you.

!# Tim @ 4:26

I have, over the years, just have become more and more  fascinated by your entire life. and I really admire, not only in the work that you put out, but the entire life that you have crafted for yourself. since day one I think my fans have been asking me not will I, but when will you have Seth on the podcast so it's really fun to set aside the time. I really appreciate it.  and we also have ended up having quite a few mutual friends  that I thought, perhaps , a fun place to start would be something I only learned recently. and I guess the best way  to approach this would be just to ask you to talk about, maybe. how do you prepare coffee or vodka?

!# Seth @ 5:13

OK... hmm.... the coffee thing. @e'll start there. I don't drink coffee. I wish I did. I need a vice. But I like making it. I like the act of trying without being one of those people who measures everything because that's not my schtick to have a good intuitive sense about what makes a good pool of expresso.

And I used to have a fancy Slayer machine, which is this super digital hunk of device that didn't belong in anyone's kitchen, particularly mine. so when it started acting up I was able to sell it for a fair price. and switched in a completely opposite direction into a Swiss made 17 year old, total manual, machine. you had to pull a handle. and I roast my own beans, which is key. Marco Arment taught me that. roasting your own beans is more important than anything else you can do when when making on coffee.

And I think there is a metaphor there. I know there is a metaphor there.  which is that you can spend a lot of time to fix things later. but starting with the right raw materials makes a huge difference.

!# Tim @ 6:21

Garbage in, garbage out.

!# Seth @ 6:23

There you go.

!# Tim @ 6:24

And Macro, just for context for folks, that's Marco and I don't know why I'm having this mental blank right now, from Tumblr and now Overcast, which is a great podcast player that I use myself. Really fascinating guy in his own right. why don't you drink coffee?

!# Seth @ 6:40

It hurts my stomach.

!# Tim @ 6:42

Ah.

!# Seth @ 6:43

here's the thing. some people are gluten intolerant.  I'm just intolerant.

!# Tim @ 6:46

[Tim Laugh] And we're talking about intolerant of food products, right?

!# Seth @ 6:53

food.  not humans.  I am really good with humans. and if you had to pick one, it's better to be tolerant of humans.

!# Tim @ 6:59

and the vodka?  can we dig into that for a second?

!# Seth @ 7:02

so there's a place near my house called Stone Barns that actually used to be the Rockefeller summer house. and it's a nice restaurant.  and at the bar-- I don't drink either-- but I'm told, at the bar,  they serve honey oatmeal vodka.  and I reverse-engineered the recipe. And, it's not a Stil, but have made it in my basement.

The recipe  for those who are interested is: You take a bottle of vodka. you don't want the super cheap stuff, but you don't want the expensive stuff because that is a little bit of a rip off.  and you pour it over like a pound of plain old oatmeal, uncooked,  and half a jar of honey.  and you let it sit in the fridge for 2 weeks,  stirring it now and then. then you strain it back out back into the original bottle and you're done.

!# Tim @ 7:53

The feedback... not feedback that sounds so odd like an employee interview or something. but when I was chatting with couple of mutual friends, they said what impresses me most, or one of the thing that impresses most about Seth, is how well thought out and meticulous  all his various activities are.  is that something that started very, very early?  have you had that attention to detail for as long as you can remember?   or did some experience, or collection of people, instill that in you?

!# Seth @ 8:23

well I think it's really important that we get the scale properly here. I am meticulous compared to and amateur house painter.  I am a slob compared to you.

!# Tim @ 8:37

[Tim Laugh] That is not true.

!# Seth @ 8:40

there is nothing  about any of these tasks that could be described as meticulous.  for example,  the amount of oatmeal and honey varies widely every single time.  the coffee,  a coffee snob would probably turn up his nose at what I'm trying to do.  I don't enjoy being meticulous.  I enjoy, sort of, running roughshod  over the status quo,  learning what I can learn as I go. but nobody has ever accused me of being in meticulous.

!# Tim @ 9:13

Alright, so putting that derisive term aside, I think maybe the word that would be more appropriate, in my mind, is thoughtful.

!# Seth @ 9:22

Yes. I am very thoughtful. that's what I do. because I'm not good at sports.

!# Tim @ 9:27

[Tim Laugh] I just have to ask, because these are things I just only recently learned. so I heard from a chef friend of ours that you have the most impressive cookbook collection he has ever seen. how and why?

!# Seth @ 9:44

 well. ok.  so before Amazon,  I was a book packager.  and what book packages do for a living is come up with ideas for books and then make them.  and I made 120 books  in 10 years-- a book a month.  I made best sellers.   I made books that sold no copies.  I made books on gardening.  I did trivia projects.  I made books all over the map.

and the way you do that is you work with an expert. so my second book was  professor herb Barnes, On the Spot, spot and stain removal guide. and herb was the world's expert on spot and stain removal.  the deal was I got his notebook and he got half the money. I did all the work.

but sometimes you don't have an expert with you so what you do is go to the bookstore and buy every book on the topic. and that's how my book collection grew too many thousands of books.  because a book is a bargain.  still a screaming bargain.  you pay 15, 20 bucks and you have something that might change your life.  you have something that reminds you 20 years later, sitting on the shelf, where you were when you read it.  I love buying books.

 so the cookbook thing started with my mom's copy of The Joy of Cooking.  and every time I saw a cookbook that seemed like I would get three good insights out of it, I bought it because it was a screaming bargain.  and then it grew and it grew.  then Amazon showed up, with one-click shopping,  and maybe should buy this one next. growing up,  people in my house would, the doorbell ring,  and people  would yell,  "Amazon is here!" because every night the door bell would ring. so that is where the cookbooks come come from.

!# Tim @ 11:30

if you had someone over for dinner,  and I heard you are an incredible cook,  and they said they wanted to learn how to cook, are there any particular books that you would recommend to them?  or approaches for that matter?

!# Seth @ 11:44

for just about anybody,  the right answer is the 4 Hour Chef.

!# Tim @ 11:49

[Tim Laugh] that wasn't intended to be a soft ball. I wasn't trying to set that up.

!# Seth @ 11:54

because, before the book,  you had to weave together, you know, a thirty second narrative to help somebody I think about  what cooking meant.  my wife got me a Chris Schlessinger cooking class.  It was the only cooking class I have ever taken. and in 20 minutes I learned more about cooking  then I think I learned before or since.

!# Tim @ 12:18

Wow.

!# Seth @ 12:19

Because Kris taught me basically how to think  about what you are trying to do.  and basically said, A) you should taste the food as you go, which surprisingly only a small number of people do. and B, he said, salt and olive oil  are actually cheating.  they are secret weapons and they always work.  you can even add them to ice cream.   they just always work.  so, for me, part of the thoughtfulness is I don't use a lot of salt and I don't use a lot of olive oil  because I know I could, but its cheating.

I like to think about cooking  as a metaphor  for most of what you been teaching.  The real lesson of what you have been teaching-- not the detail stuff.  Which is that it costs very little to find out.

!# Tim @ 13:12

Yes. Exactly.

!# Seth @ 13:13

Lots of people are afraid to find out and that's why they are bad at coking.  The thing that I love about cooking, because my project like yours sometimes last for years, is that cooking lasts for an hour, and at the end you have success or fail.  And that cycle of, "I have an idea for and we are sitting down at six", is something that I like very much.

I'll tell you a story that I don't think I have ever told out loud.  I used to go shopping every single night because I cooked for the family for many, many years every single night.  I still mostly do.  I would stop at the Korean Deli by my house. It was a fish store. It was a flower shop. And it was a nice fresh vegetable place.

The man who owned it was a friend on mine. I used to bring him my books when they were translated into Korean, which was fun. Every single night I would go to get the freshest stuff... Anyway, a giant evil drug store chain bought the place and tore it down and put up an evil drugstore.

I didn't know how to commemorate this loss. I ended up going online to one of those places that sell those brass architectural plaques, and I had a  brass architectural plaque honoring the place. I fixed it to the side of the drug store, where it has been for the last five years unmolested.

!# Tim @ 14:46

[Laughs] That's amazing.

The tangible aspect of cooking-- and this is something that I completely agree with you on-- compared to some of the more abstract or longer term projects, when you have something to show for your effort at the end that is very tangible and tactile... Is that part of the reason that you are as interested in audio equipment as you are? Or appear to be-- I have never been to your house. But, so I hear you have the most incredible sound system many people have ever seen. I don't know what the details are, but is there an analogue, tactile driver behind that? Or what is the reason behind that?

!# Seth @ 15:37

Well. OK. So here is the arc for me for many, many years has been railing against various industrial complexes-- the TV industrial complex, the educational industrial complex, and this corporatization of just about everything. I was in China eight weeks ago. There is a village outside of Shenzhen called Dafen where they paint 1/3 of all the oil paintings in the world, over and over as fast as they can.

These paintings aren't art. They are merely paintings. They are what happens if a giant, big box store needs 10,000 oil paintings. This is how they get them.

What I discovered... I was at my friend Steve's house 20 years ago and he had a big pile of this magazine called [Stereophile](http://www.stereophile.com/). Stereophile is a handmade magazine about handmade audio equipment with people arguing with each other about this, that and the other thing-- a lot of arguing. It was really fun to read. You know, I have no interest in baseball whats so ever, but this was like baseball in that you could track the careers of the various artisans. You could be on one side or the other is these discussions.

So for me, I started by buying inexpensive, used stuff. There is a marketplace on online called [AudioGon](https://www.audiogon.com/), where you can find people who buy things new and sell them six months later in perfect condition. I found that connecting to the artisan, understanding their point of view... Finding the guy in Cleveland, who makes speaker wire by hand.. Finding the [Paul McGowan](http://www.psaudio.com/community/pauls-posts/) in Boulder, Co, who is at the cutting edge of certain parts of the stereo, but not other ones. Making them in Boulder with a team of people.

It gives me pleasure and that pleasure is a placebo that makes music sound better. The act of carefully choosing what you are going to listen to, knowing that the heritage and the [terwar] of the thing behind it. It feels to me like a productive hobby that doesn't hurt anybody so it is something that I spend some time on.

!# Tim @ 17:55

How do you consume media? Or what type of media do you consume? Is the bulk of it still in book form, that is hardcopy? How do you consume media?

!# Seth @ 18:10

Well, I'll start with I don't watch any television that is live, and I feel strongly that most people shouldn't. I think that one of the single best hacks is that, after Seinfeld went off the air, that was it. We ripped it out and it frees up hours and hours everyday to explore media or content that is up to you, opposed to somebody else. And I don't watch any TV at home, recorded or otherwise.

So that leaves me with books and kindle and music mostly. The thing with books is I really don't have the patience for literature. I didn't grow up with literature. I was an engineer in college. I just never got the knack for decoding really dense fiction.

So, on the other hand, like you, everyday the mailman brings unsolicited books in the mail. There is a very high throughput of reading books before most people get to see them. Once you do it enough you don't have to read the whole thing to get the joke. Every once in a while, it is good enough that you keep going. If I [blurbed] it, it means I went all the way to the end.

I love reading books on paper. It's harder for me to read books on the Kindle when I am not traveling because it doesn't have that proustian reminder to me of what a book actually means. So, one of the things that people in my generation are discovering is that people who are 20 or 30 are coming up viewing books as nothing but a reminder of the drudgery of high school.

If a book is on an electronic device, it is one click away from email, and email is always better than reading a book if you are 25. I fear for the future of our medium because it doesn't have the place in our culture that it used to.

!# Tim @ 20:20

How do you determine... and if the book blurb, for a particular example, is going to create a delus that you don't want we don't have to address that one... but I have been very impressed in some of our conversations by the rules that you established for yourself-- for saying yes or no to certain things. Perhaps we could start, if you are willing to talk about it, with speaking engagements... speaking engagements as you've experienced it... if you have a successful book, it went from kind of 0 to 60 unexpectedly, and you said yes to everything. And it just turned into a parody of Up In the Air. I felt like a traveling salesman, or Jack Lemon and Glen Ross. It was horrible. What are your rules for, for instance speaking engagements, to whatever extent you are comfortably talking about them?

!# Seth @ 21:16

I would be happy to. And then I will scroll back a little bit and tell you why I have to have rules for things like that.

For speaking engagements, I don't want to do more than 30 per year because they are, at least for me, not additive to the joy of my day, except for the hour that I am onstage. I am prepared to do an unlimited number of speaking engagements in zip code 10706.

Monday I am going to Carnegie Hall to talk for free to 25 music students who have devoted their lives to doing what they do. It is a privilege to do something like that. If I have to get on an airplane, it is a whole other project. So I think really hard about what impact I am trying to make, and will this help me move things forward, which is where this nests into.

My mentor and late friend Zig Ziglar used to talk about the idea... he used to say, "I never changed anyone's life with a speaking gig. But sometimes I do a speaking gig and they buy my cassettes. And if they buy my cassettes I have a shot at changing their life." For me, my mission, and it has been for a long time, is to make a certain kind of change happen.

I want to help people see the world differently. And if they choose to make a different choice after they see the world differently. I want to help people connect to each other, and to use that connection to make things better. I don't want to be a TV personality so the question is how do I bring that teaching to people. What I found is that it is a very unique situation when you have 500 or 5,000 high-powered people in a room, who didn't expect that you were going to be there, but that now that you are there are eager to hear what you have to say. And they set aside their Twitter account, and they set aside their preconceptions, and for 45 minutes to an hour you have a screen that is 30 feet by 20 feet, and you have a microphone that is amplified. And maybe just maybe you can get under their skin. If you do, maybe just maybe, they go back to their office and get ten copies of [Your Turn](http://www.amazon.com/What-When-Your-Turn-Always/dp/1936719320) and hand them out to their team. Then I can do that practice that I seek, which is to change the conversation.

That is why I do it at all.

!# Tim @ 23:52

The further away it is, the less likely you are to say, "yes"? Is that fair to say?

!# Seth @ 23:39

Yeah. What I did was, having studied a little bit of economics, is that I changed the price. Los Angeles costs three times as much as New York. And if you don't think that is fair, don't make me come to Los Angeles.

!# Tim @ 24:14

[Laughs] You were going to elaborate on why you need rules, and maybe you just did. Maybe that was the answer. But...

!# Seth @ 24:23

Well, because, you know, the phone rings, right, and lots of people want a thing. If it doesn't align with the thing that is your mission, and you say yes, then now it is their mission. There is nothing wrong with being a wandering generality instead of a meaningful specific, but don't expect to make the change you seek to make if that is what you do.

The thing is... I thought your interview with Derek was one of the best ones you've ever done.

!# Tim @ 24:52

Thanks. Derek makes it quite easy. [Laughs] Derek Sivers is amazing.

!# Seth @ 24:56

I adore him. He talked about offense vs defense. If you think hard about ones life, most people spend most of their time on defense-- in reactive mode. In playing with the cards that they got instead of moving to a different table with different cards. Instead of seeking to change other people, they are willing to be changed.

Part of the arc which I am trying to teach is everyone who can hear this has more power than they think they do. The question is what are you going to do with that power. Because it comes with responsibility (right out of Spiderman). That responsibility is you're going to make change happen, or you're going to ignore it, and if you make change happen that is on you.

!# Tim @ 25:47

I was just pausing because I was thinking about how well anyone who is listening to this podcast, relative to the vast majority of people on the planet, how well they are doing. For whatever reason I was just bridging the gap between our little text exchange before the call where I asked you if you were ready and you said, "Born ready. Not actually. I was born naked, and afraid, and unable to read, unable to type." If you look at that progression: Making it from there to where we are collectively, everyone listening to this podcast, or being on it, it's pretty astonishing.

The...

!# Seth @ 26:26

Can I just interrupt you for a second?

!# Tim @ 26:28

Yes sir.

!# Seth @ 26:29

I think that's part of the secret plan of Tim Ferriss, which is.. When you came out of the gate, it was, or felt like, here is some techniques and some shortcuts. It was seen as an early version of the life hacking thing. But I don't think that is what you are really doing. I think what you are really doing is saying to people, "Alright, now that you are so much more fit in every area-- mentally, physically, emotionally and spiritually. What are you going to do with it."

When you think about the Sineca stuff, and the podcast, that is where you have been going for a long time. And I for one just wanted to call you out and applaud you on it because it is not the easy path, it is the path that's important, and you have been consistent and showed up and done the work.

!# Tim @ 27:22

Thank you. That mean a lot to me. You are correct... The tactics get people in the door so to speak. Then the question is, alright once you have of this finite resource called time and you've sharpened the axe in these various areas where you apply your effort.

This is maybe going to turn into a therapy session for myself, but I have found myself
