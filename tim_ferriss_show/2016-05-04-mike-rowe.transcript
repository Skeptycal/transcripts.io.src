!# Tim @ 00:02:54

Hello lady and germs. This is Tim Ferriss and welcome to another episode of the Tim Ferriss Show. I've had a bit of wine to drink. And by a bit I mean two bottles with a friend of [Pleiades by Sean Thackrey](https://www.klwines.com/Products/i?i=1142179), which I highly recommend.

This show is usually about deconstructing world class experts. This episode is no exception. Although instead of a chess prodigy, or a military strategist, or an entertainment icon, we have perhaps the best story teller and pitch man I ever had on this show. Certainly he would give [Cal Fussman](http://fourhourworkweek.com/2016/03/11/the-interview-master-cal-fussman-and-the-power-of-listening/) a run for his money. He is none other than Mike Rowe.

Mike Rowe you may now from Dirty Jobs, but I am going to read his bio because I had enough to drink. This is on [MikeRowe.com](http://mikerowe.com). Having spent some time with Mike now, this is very fitting. Here we go. I am going to read the entire paragraph so bear with me.

This episode I will say is so worth listening to in its entirety because we cover:

1. How to sell a pencil
2. QVC
3. The meaning of freelance
4. The business of Mike Rowe
5. His mentors
6. Some of his favorite influences
7. Favorite books
8. The art of voice over
9. Bruno Mars, and how he became Bruno Mars
10. Orson Wells

... It goes on, and on, and on. I had a blast with this. Just got back from spending some time after the interview with Mike. I hope we have a part 2 at a point.... [laughs] point 3? Oh Jesus, I am with somebody next to me and they are admiring my state of inebriation.  Here we go, Mike Rowe from the website:

> Mike Rowe is a TV host, writer, narrator, producer, actor and spokesman. His performing career began in 1984, when he faked his way into the Baltimore Opera to get his union card and meet girls, both of which he accomplished during a performance of Rigoletto. His transition to television occurred in 1990 when — to settle a bet — he auditioned for the QVC Shopping Channel and was promptly hired after talking about a pencil for nearly eight minutes. There, he worked the graveyard shift for three years, until he was ultimately fired for making fun of products and belittling viewers.

So, all of that is true and we dig into it. You should say "hi" to Mike on either, and or, Twitter at [@mikeroweworks](https://twitter.com/mikeroweworks), or on Facebook at the [TheRealMikeRowe](https://www.facebook.com/TheRealMikeRowe/). This was a blast of a conversation that I wanted to have for 15, 20 years. I hope you enjoy it. And with out further ado here is my conversation with the inimitable Mike Rowe.

!# Tim @ 00:05:58

Mike, welcome to the show.

!# Mike @ 00:05:59

I think you mean welcome to your living room.

!# Tim @ 00:06:01

Welcome to the esteem studio of Tim Ferriss Enterprise i.e. my living room.

!# Mike @ 00:06:06

Sophisticated, understated, with a certain insouciance, and dare I say asian influence.

!# Tim @ 00:06:12

[Laughs] That is actually my tinder description.

!# Mike @ 00:06:14

Not bad. Is it working?

!# Tim @ 00:06:17

[Laughs] It's converting pretty well.

I have wanted to have the chance to sit down with you for many years. I wanted to thank you right off the bat.. I am not sure if I mentioned this when we met, which we will get to, for the first time. But, you helped keep me sane for a period of several years where I had extremely punishing job from about 2000 to 2002 specifically. That is when I was logging the most hours... I would come home and there were two shows: Dirty Jobs (so you) then Jeff Corwin, who were like my tele-therapists. So I just wanted to thank you for putting out good work.

!# Mike @ 00:07:02

Well, you're welcome. I mean when people say things could always be worse, it means whatever you decide it means. But then when you can actually turn on the TV and see some sort of actual optical manifestation of what worse is. Well there you go. You know, reinforcement.

!# Tim @ 00:07:18

[Laughs] Well, I remember one episode in particular... ah, I remember several episodes of course, but one came to mind. I have seen you do really, really dirty stuff. There was one where I think you were winterizing a boat, and you just looked so bored out of your mind. I just remembered thinking exactly what you said. You know sitting in the fire exit, violating code at this startup, being unable to move, sleeping under my desk; those are all hard things, but at least I am not doing that.

!# Mike @ 00:07:47

I am not wrapping a boat. Yeah, that was Manhattan Beach. Oddly named since we were in Cincinnati, on the river. It was, I think, late November. All of the pleasure crafts down there, you know, are obviously vulnerable and susceptible to the climate in a huge way. I mean they will just crack; it just gets so cold. A team of guys wrap them in the same way that you might wrap your sandwich in Saran Wrap, except it is industrial strength Saran Wrap, and it goes all the way around the boat.

And, of course, it is freezing rain. You are on a boat. It is slicker than snot. You are flying around. Your camera man is flying around. Cameras are flying through the air. The sound man is cursing you. Everybody is just... you know, it is just humiliating to, like if you can't skate to find yourself on the ice. It is no fun. That was basically, metaphorically anyway, eight years of my life. It was Groundhog Day in a sewer in some way shape or form, even if you are wrapping a boat.

!# Tim @ 00:08:52

So another episode that sort of ties us back to our experience at TED/The EG that were sort of part of the same parcel is... My opener, because I was so curious about it, and just remind me before I get into it. Was it sheep?

!# Mike @ 00:09:11

Yeah, we were...

!# Tim @ 00:09:13

So sheep testicles?

!# Mike @ 00:09:14

We were on an escalator actually heading up to the main auditorium and I heard a voice behind me say, "I want to hear about the testicles." Which you know, as a rule, is impossible to ignore. When you are in a crowd, sort of doubly so. So I spun around and there you were, Tim Ferriss. Yeah, we had a funny little exchange. But it was, you know, apocryphal for me because on the way up the escalator what was really going through my mind was, "what in the hell am I going to talk about here."

Because the Discovery Channel had sent me down there. This was what 2008, maybe?

!# Tim @ 00:09:51

2008, I think.

!# Mike @ 00:09:52

So Discovery is one of the sponsors of this thing and they send me down there. I was the Discovery guy in those days basically. They said, "Yeah, it is this thing. It is like TED." I didn't know. I have never heard of TED. I am like so there is some guy named Ted, who I should know and I don't so I am just going to pretend like I do. OK so there is a guy named TED and he is down in Monterey and we need you to go because we are sponsoring his thing and introduce some people and say something smart on behalf of the network. That is why I was there.

When I walked in, I saw the giant banner hanging from the ceiling. I saw my face on it. I realized very quickly that I was there in fact to say something something not only memorable, but recordable for posterity... [Laughs]... in like three hours.

Yeah, I didn't have any visual aids. I didn't have any real... nothing, except a lot of stories. As I was going through them in my mind, I hear your disembodied voice. You know it's not a high voice, it's not a low voice.You're familiar with your voice. In fact let's relive it right now. Say to me, "Mike, I want to hear about the testicles."

!# Tim @ 00:11:05

Mike, I want to hear about the testicles.

!# Mike @ 00:11:08

And just like that I am back in Monterey.

!# Tim @ 00:11:10

[Laughs]

!# Mike @ 00:11:12

So I turn around and say, "ah, you're talking about the sheep." And you said, "yes." And we had a few laughs regarding the time I bit the balls off of lambs in Craig, Colorado at 8000 feet.

!# Tim @ 00:11:23

Now, just for people who are missing the context, can you explain why you were biting the testicles off of..

!# Mike @ 00:11:30

There was no context it was just Thursday. [Laughs]

!# Tim @ 00:11:33

[Laughs] Thursday after lunch. Three martinis and that is what you do.

!# Mike @ 00:11:37

I need a little something to take the edge off. [Laughs]

No, the business of animal husbandry was a very, very important component of Dirty Jobs. We worked our way through feces from every species. We suddenly realized that collecting semen from various barn yard animals was great television. Beyond the spectacle of it, just a great way to connect people to their food because artificial insemination is in fact... I mean we are just not feeding 300 million people, 3 times a day , if we don't do that.

I was always on the lookout for interesting agricultural misadventures, and ways that we could, you know, be intelligent, but at the same satisfy the more puerile aspects of my viewers-- God love them. When I got the call to really explore... they called it sheep docker, which means... With the spring lambs, you have to take their tails and their testicles.

So, I thought this is visually both alarming and potentially stunning. But, I had problems. You know Dirty Jobs was constantly under attack by an army of angry acronyms. You know I had long since fallen off the christmas card list of OSHA and PETA and the Humane Society.

So I called PETA and said, "listen, we are going to castrating sheep. I just want to make sure that we do it right." What followed was a completely bizarre conversation that ultimately led to the TED talk that I gave. Yeah, we touched on everything from [Anagnorisis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anagnorisis) to [Peripeteia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peripeteia) to modern day agriculture to regret, and of course, the unforgettable taste of testicles.

!# Tim @ 00:13:27

So, the visual I want to try and recreate, which is just indelibly imprinted on my mind was... you basically pick the sheep up and, please tell me if I am getting this wrong, you kind of splay them as if they are in a gynecological chair on top of a fence post?

!# Mike @ 00:13:44

Well, the fence post was what was handy. Look, we should be very, very clear. The reasons that ranchers for centuries have been biting the balls off of sheep is because it is not only more efficient; it is actually kinder.

This, of course, was the point of the talk. When I called the Humane Society and PETA, they were very specific in telling me the proper method, which involved a rubber band that would go over the scrotum. There by retarding the flow of blood to the testicles and ultimately resulting in their detachment in about three days. That's the quote, unquote right way to do it.

Albert and Melanie, the people who ran the ranch, did it the old fashioned way. When you do it the old fashioned way, you only need two people. The way I just described requires three: Someone to handle the scrotum, someone to handle the rubber band, and someone to control the creature. But, in this case, Melanie just put the lamb right up on the fence post and Albert reached in and pulled the scrotum out, cut the tip off, exposed the testicles, leaned down, bit them off and spit them in a bucket that I was holding. Making a sound of the lines of "Donk Donk".

Stunning television, but obviously unusable. So I yelled cut, which I never do on Dirty Jobs, and explained to Albert look we have to do it the right way. He said what are you talking about. I said with the rubber bands. So we used the rubber bands and quickly determined that the sheep with rubber bands around their scrotums were stumbling around in abject misery, while the ones that he had just orally addressed were prancing around without a care in the world.

The point of that talk was really to challenge the primacy of experts. At the same time, say it is possible to do honest television that is both disgusting and intelligent in a tertiary way.

!# Tim @ 00:15:47

How did you become good at impromptu performance? Because the fact of the matter is, at that same event... And I watched your talk, it was a very good talk I thought. The vast majority of other presenters probably spent weeks or months agonizing over what they were going to do. But you seem to have just an incredible, innate-- and I hate to use that word, but I'll throw it in there just for the fun of it-- ability to improvise and perform. Where does that come from?

!# Mike @ 00:16:17

Thanks. I don't is is the honest answer. But, if I had to guess, I would say... one of things that was important on Dirty Jobs, and one of the few that I really insisted upon, was no second takes. The reason I did that wasn't because I thought it would make the show better. I did it because I thought it would make the show more authentic.

Everybody was talking about the importance of authenticity back in 2003.  They still are today. It's really hard to do. You know when you consider how many people say it is critically important and then look at the things that people do to put barriers between themselves and the authentic experience they actually want to impart. It will break your heart. Turn on news. Listen to FM radio. The reason it all sounds the same. The reason most TV I think looks the same is because we are all doing it the same basic way.

My hope with Dirty Jobs was to say, "Listen, this is going to be a hot mess. I mean this is worts and all. We are going to go into the field with a good natured crew. Everybody has a camera. We never stop rolling unless we have to. And we never go back to quote, unquote pick it up." I don't think I am necessarily good at improvising, but I am almost always better at take one. Because I do a lot of other things  now that, you know, I like to get along with people and so they want to do it again so I'll do it again.

But it doesn't matter how facile you are the second time. The second time is always going to be a performance. I learned that lesson early on and forgot it for about 15 years. Then with Dirty Jobs had a chance to circle back and live it.

Whether it is a speech, or a show, or a commercial, or a podcast, or a Facebook post, whatever it is, you know, I want to get it right but not to the point where I will completely forsake the first pass.

!# Tim @ 00:18:26

I want to flash back to a part of your history that actually I have not heard much about and that is QVC, or was it Home Shopping?

!# Mike @ 00:18:38

QVC, but a distinction without a difference.

!# Tim @ 00:18:41

[Laughs] Distinction without a difference. Just don't want to offend anyone at corporate if they are listening. Suzan, Susan, you know you have to be sensitive about these things.

How did you end up working at QVC?

!# Mike @ 00:18:57

Honestly, in the same way I got most of my jobs back in the day. I lost a bet and I crashed an audition. I was singing. This was 1989 and I was in the Baltimore Opera. It was during a performance of [Der Ring des Nibelungen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Der_Ring_des_Nibelungen), Wagner, interminal derg. I was  dressed as a viking. I didn't need to be on stage for the intermission obviously, but then for an hour after, which meant I could walk across the street and watch the football game at the Mount Royal Tavern, dressed as a viking, which of course I did.

Look, if you haven't had a couple of beers then sung Wagner, I hardily recommend it, especially if you can put on the viking helmet.  Anyway, I walk into the bar and my buddy Rick was pouring the beer, but the game was not on-- the Ravens were not playing-- instead he was watching a fat guy in a shiny suit selling pots and pans. I said, "Rick, what the hell are you doing." He said, "I am auditioning for that guy's job tomorrow. QVC is in town and they are having an open cattle call down at the Marriot and I am going to go see if I can get an actual job."  So I sat there, dressed as a viking, drinking National Bohemian Beer, arguing with Rick over the dismiss of western civilization. He bet me $100 that I wouldn't get a call back if I accompanied him to the audition, which I did. The next day... This is kind of a long answer to your question... but the next day...

!# Tim @ 00:20:40

This is a long podcast. [Laughs]

!# Mike @ 00:20:42

Oh good. Let me hit you with a little interpretive dance....

So I wind up auditioning that next morning in a conference room at the Marriott Renaissance in Baltimore inner harbor, which is maybe the strangest audition of my life. I didn't get a call back, but I got a job offer on the spot.

!# Tim @ 00:21:05

So what was the audition like? What was the audition process?

!# Mike @ 00:21:11

It was elegant in a way that I know you will appreciate as a guy who measures some value of efficiency and effectiveness. It was elegance personified by a company who had abjectly failed to create a workable audition process.

So it is 1989. The home shopping industry is just the part of the map where it says "here be dragons". You can't hire an actor and expect him or her to know how to sell. And you can't really hire a salesman and expect him or her not to shit the bed when somebody says "action." Right? So it is a very weird set of muscles. The way that they determined potential candidates, in my case, was they rolled a pencil across the desk while the camera was rolling, and the man said, "When I ask you to, I want you to pick up the pencil and I want you to talk about it. And I want you to make me want it. I don't care how you make me want it. I don't care what you tell me to make me want it. I don't care if it is true or not. But I want you to harness whatever enthusiasm and passion you can muster for this #2 Pencil and do not stop talking until I tell you to." I learned later that anyone who could do that for 8 minutes was immediately hired and put on a 3 month probationary period, where you were giving enough rope to truly hang yourself from 3-6 AM every morning on live television. So anyway that is how it happened. I talked about a pencil for 8 minutes.

!# Tim @ 00:22:53

Do you remember any particular feature or benefit that you focused on?

!# Mike @ 00:22:58

It is interesting that you use those words because if you are really trying to sell in a classic sense, or kill time in a practical sense, there is no better approach then the feature/benefit. So, all the obvious things. It's yellow. Now that's a feature. If you limit yourself to simply saying, "yellow," then you are going to be out of time real fast. Why is yellow important? Well, because you are a busy executive in the middle of a busy day and when you need a pencil and open up that top drawer of your desk and gaze into it, you don't want to play some sort of game with your receptors. You want a color that pops out there. You want to know where that pencil is and what better way to do it than by this bright canary shade of yellow. Then, of course, if you want to take a little detour, right, you can talk about the exact hue of yellow. Then you can talk about where the paint came from, or how the paint was mixed, and where the paint was mixed. You might even leave the viewer with an image of the person mixing the paint to create the exact shade of canary yellow. Then, of course, you can touch on the application process. Before long, you've talked yourself into this endless tautology just about the color of the pencil.

!# Tim @ 00:24:15

It is a New Yorker piece.

!# Mike @ 00:24:16

It could be. Sure.

!# Tim @ 00:24:19

When you started then selling at QVC, what distinguished the best performers from everybody else?

!# Mike @ 00:24:30

Again, everybody was making it up as they went along. In those days, at QVC, you know it is not like Fortune 500 companies were lining up, begging to be on as they are today. People would go out and do whatever they could to maintain a three or four thousand SKU inventory. Back then that inventory, I think, would be best described as the interior of one of those machines on the carnival midway, where the claw tries to grab the thing, and then drop it for you. It was just Tchotchkes. It was Capital del Monte. It was porcelain.  It was collectible dolls. It was the cheapest kind of electronics. It was health team infrared pain reliever.

!# Tim @ 00:25:22

Did you guys have the knives and like oddly designed ninja swords and what not? Because that has always memorized me. Were those part of the package at that point?

!# Mike @ 00:25:31

There must have been corporate policy frowning on swords at QVC, but of course they got there own channel later on. We had knives. We had "In the Kitchen with Mike." We had knives with full tang construction I recall, you know...The metal runs all the way down into the handle. We had cookware coated with polytetrafluoroethylene. T-Fal, the slickest surface there is. I mean all of this stuff. It was just an endless smear of adverbs and unpronounceable things.

I mean to answer your question. The people that were good at it took it seriously. They showed up three hours early. They studied the products. They committed things to memory. And they did the best they could. The people like me, who never really got off the graveyard shift, looked at all of that as a wonderful opportunity to personate David Letterman, which is really all I did.

!# Tim @ 00:26:37

I have actually visited QVC headquarters once. I don't actually, for whatever reason, recall the reason, but I...

!# Mike @ 00:26:47

Only you would go to QVC headquarters for reasons unknown.

!# Tim @ 00:26:51

I leaped at the opportunity. I think I might have been dating.. where is the headquarters?

!# Mike @ 00:26:56

At the seventh level of hell as I recall.

!# Tim @ 00:26:58

Which state though?

!# Mike @ 00:27:00

No, there in Pennsylvania.

!# Tim @ 00:27:01

OK. I knew it. I think I was dating a girl around, what is it King of Prussia?

!# Mike @ 00:27:05

King of Prussia.

!# Tim @ 00:27:06

There we go. And I think I was just foresaken or left along with nothing to do and decided to go to QVC and that was it. I took a tour and I remember being so impressed, at the time-- this was probably '99, with the control room and the units and dollars per minute being moved by different presenters.

!# Mike @ 00:27:29

Staggering.

!# Tim @ 00:27:30

At the time that you were there, did you have an ear piece where they fed you feedback?

!# Mike @ 00:27:35

I had two ear pieces at the time. One so the producer could tell me how I was doing, or beg me to stop doing whatever it was I was doing. And then another one to handle the live phone calls, which were extraordinary.

In '89 and '90, it was like radio days. You know it was like early television, early radio. We didn't have a second second delay. We are utterly live. So you are really out there without a net. The number of things that could go wrong and the degree to which they did are nothing short of spectacular. One day, if there is time, I am going to write the book because it was just wild. But, in defense of home shopping, I have great fun in looking back and casting aspersions, but the truth is I learned more in my three years at QVC than I ever learned anywhere about anything. I probably even learned more about myself, which you will do at 3AM when you are staring into the abyss and it's staring back and you are trying to make a Precious Moment figurine interesting. You'll go places that you didn't know you would go.

Kidding aside, it was probably the most honest channel in the entire cable universe. It's utterly without pretense. It's a twenty four hour commercial. There is no clever integration.

!# Tim @ 00:29:03

It's not native advertising. [Laughs]

!# Mike @ 00:29:06

It is clear and present proposition. It's transactional TV. I just think it is just also a monument to capitalism.

!# Tim @ 00:29:19

When did... and we were sitting down and chatting before we started recording... when did American Airlines fit into your chronology?

!# Mike @ 00:29:28

Oh God. Well, in 1993 I was fired for the third time from QVC.

!# Tim @ 00:29:36

Hold on. I have to pause. So fired from the third time. Does that mean they fired you and begged you to come back? Or that you...

!# Mike @ 00:29:42

I wouldn't say, "begged." Each situation was different. When I was fired the first time, I had only been there about 2 months. I stayed on a kind of... What did they call it in [Animal House](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0077975/)?... double secret probation for the next three years.

Because remember, for me the products were there to be made fun of. The callers were there to help me. I didn't see them as customers. My first night on the air, I picked up the [Amcor Negative Ion Generator](http://www.qvc.com/Amcor-Negative-Ion-Generator.product.Z468.html) and I looked into the camera and I said, "Look, this is item _E1410_." Now, at the time, there were also items like _E2800960_. So _E1410_ meant that that thing had been there from day 1. We had been selling it for years. I had never seen it before and I didn't know what it did. I looked into the camera and said, "If one of you people at home. And I'm talking to you, you narcoleptic, lonely heart right now. It's 3:30 in the morning. You. You know who you are. You are watching me sit here about to go up in flames because I have no idea what this thing is. Could you please call in so my producer can put you on the air so you can tell me how this works?" I swear to God I did that. And I got overwhelmed with phone calls-- hundreds of people-- which at 3:30 in the morning is saying something. Hundreds of people called in to tell me how to do my job on live TV. And it was... it was awesome.

!# Tim @ 00:31:20

[Laughs] It sounds incredible.

!# Mike @ 00:31:22

It was great. I would look out at the producer, who was sound asleep.

!# Tim @ 00:31:27

[Laughs] Just silence in the ear bud. You're like trying to fit his name into your dialog so he wakes up like [meow with Super Troopers](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZkKsGtrW88).

!# Mike @ 00:31:38

He didn't have his ear bud in. His feet are up. He had fallen asleep doing a sudoku like 20 minutes earlier and he had thick trails of saliva coming out of his mouth and going all the way down to his chest.

I was utterly alone on stage, say for this product coordinators who would bring me this never ending chain of drek that had failed to sell in primetime. You know. That's what it was 3 hours a night. The viewers became... they were never customers to me. They were this good natured, but slightly dangerous group of people, kind of like a Greek chorus, who would call in and instruct me. I would mess with them and they would mess with me. Occasionally, the calls would become utterly obscene and then things would really go off the rails.

Honestly, Tim, we could talk about this for days. It was utterly transformational. I had never been on TV before. Ever. I had never had a job in broadcasting before. And suddenly, it's 3 in the morning. I am on live television. People I don't know are bringing me things I can't describe. And I am completely reliant upon the viewers to get me through the shift.

!# Tim @ 00:32:54

So, with this petri dish of live broadcasting, and with all of your experimentation, you get fired for the third time. Enter stage left, American Airlines. How did you go from there?

!# Mike @ 00:33:08

Well, for me what happened was... After 3 years, I did develop a pretty good set of muscles. I became a very good auditioner. I had always wanted to be a tradesman to tell you the truth. I didn't get that gene; it is recessive. Everybody in my family did but I didn't.

But I always looked at TV as a trade. I finally felt like I had a toolbox that would allow to approach it the way that I always wanted to, which was as a mercenary. I mean truly as a freelancer. You're familiar with the word "freelance" and its origin?

!# Tim @ 00:33:48

I do not know the [etymology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Etymology) of "freelance".

!# Mike @ 00:33:50

So the etymology of "freelance" is exactly as it sounds. The mediaeval days, if you were a freelance, you were a knight without a lord.

!# Tim @ 00:34:01

You were a roman mercenary.

!# Mike @ 00:34:02

You were a mercenary. I just loved the idea of going to [Hollywood](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hollywood) without an agent, without a manager, without a publicist, without a lawyer, and booking as much work as I could. I didn't care about the work. I didn't care about the quality of the work. I didn't care if it was infomercials. I didn't care if it was books on tape. I didn't care if it was sitcoms, or talkshows. It didn't matter. I did it all. I tried it all and got my share.

By 1995, I had had dozens and dozens of jobs in Hollywood and New York... feeling kind of arrogant. The way you do when you think you figured something out that most people haven't. So I was freelancing. Many, many jobs. Eight months on, four months off.

I patterned that part of my career after [John D. MacDonald's Travis McGee](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Travis_McGee) in fact. A guy who took his retirement in early installments. I just loved it. American Airlines was one of maybe 300 jobs that I [Forest Gump](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0109830/)ed my way into.

In what capacity were you working?

!# Mike @ 00:35:19

Well, American in '95 realized how value the real estate was in their planes on a screen. You got 3 or 4 hundred truly captive business travelers, right. They had been doing advertising, but they hadn't really been going after it. So, they made big deals with CI and Xerox, and, in the day, all of the usual suspects. All they needed was content.

So they hired this company, which wound up hiring me to create a show called _On Air TV_. Nobody cared what the show really was as long, as it was family friendly, as long as it unfolded in a destination served by any of American's routes.

So, I would fly anywhere in the world. Land in Copenhagen. Land in Sydney, Las Vegas, didn't matter. I spent 3 days there and I would do a show about that town. So basically I am a tourist doing all the fun things you would do in any of those places. It's purpose, like any content really, is just to provide a landing place for the advertising.

For me, as a 32 year old kid out there in the world, it was maybe the best freelance gig I had ever had because they issued a thing called the D3. A D3, in airline parlance, is called a _MF_, or a _Must Fly_. If you walked up to the gate-- this was pre-911, obviously-- but if you walked right up to the gate, showed them the D3, the agent takes it, looks at it, her eyebrows go up because she doesn't see a lot of them, it's just for the board basically. Picks up the phone. Calls the number. Hits in a code and you get on the plane. You fly first class even if they have to pull someone off.

Mine was a D3 plus one because I always had a camera man. We were on airline business. We flew last minute often. This went on for about a year while we were in production for this show called _On Air_. Then a guy named Crandel came in; I think it was Crandel, American Airlines.

That space became even more valuable. They decided to do a deal with [Brandon Tartikoff](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brandon_Tartikoff), and NBC, and brought in [Seinfeld](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seinfeld), and other legitimate shows to really justify the advertising, which meant I was out of a gig, again. But, they never took the D3 back.

[Laughs] It is like the keycard that gets you back into the building.

!# Mike @ 00:37:56

It was Willy Wonka. I was for a year, maybe 15 months, without question-- and I say this  with all do modesty-- I think the most interesting date. You're the girl, right. We have a drink and things are going great. I say, "We should get dinner." And she says, "Yes, we should." I say, "Where would you like to go." And she say, "Anywhere." And I say, "I know a place in New Orleans." We go to the airport and we clear security and we walk right on the plane. And she looks at me and says, "Who are you?" And I say, "No one of any consequence." It's just ridiculous. I'm flying around the world with this magical thing.

!# Tim @ 00:38:45

Wow.

!# Mike @ 00:38:46

Yeah, it went on for awhile. I felt guilty for awhile then I got over it. Then I completely forgot about it then one day, on a random little flight by myself down to San Diego, they called in the code and the woman eyebrow went up a little bit and she held onto my D3 with both hands. Walked back towards me. Obviously, we are on other sides of the counter. She was so cool. She said, "Well, Mr. Rowe, we had a good run, didn't we?"

!# Tim @ 00:39:18

[Laughs] It is like straight out of [Catch Me If You Can](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0264464/).

!# Mike @ 00:39:24

Except I wasn't flying the plane. I was just stowing away.

!# Tim @ 00:39:30

When you were taking your four months off of these freelance gigs, who do you spend that time?

!# Mike @ 00:39:38

Well, I wasted a lot of it. Not wasted. I mean it was important time. But it was not time that I planed. All I knew was that most every month started with 30 blank squares staring back at me. I would have some anxiety, you know. Then I would look back at every month and always half to two-thirds of them had been X-ed out. Once I got used to the fact that I was always going to find enough work. Then I had to get used to the fact that I couldn't take big, elaborate trips with my off time because I really became kind of like the-- this is a terrible comparison-- but a doctor on call. I always had a beeper because I couldn't really afford to punch out, but I knew I had enough time to sit and read, and think, and write, to create, or at least maintain the illusion of fitness. To have a life, at least the life that I imagined was good for me at the time, and at the time it was. But, of course it was built on a very specific kind of fallacy and a very specific kind of hubris.

!# Tim @ 00:41:06

What type of hubris?

!# Mike @ 00:41:09

Well, like I said, the kind that allows you to look around and say, "Oh, I figured something out that you guys haven't." Right? All my friends are in the industry. All of them at this point in time ('96/'97)...

!# Tim @ 00:41:27

And by industry, you mean television?

!# Mike @ 00:41:29

Yeah. TV, radio, writing. You know they are all in the machine. They got their people. They got their agent. They got their manager. You start adding up the percentage. Then throw Uncle Sam on top of it. You almost can't afford to work.

!# Tim @ 00:41:46

You're treading water.

!# Mike @ 00:41:47

You are.

I wasn't doing that. I was really enamored of this romantic version of myself. This guy who eats what he kills. Who works when he likes. Who brings the meat back home. Who gets to fly around the world with his magic ticket. I just was loving it. What I was missing obviously... the bargain I had to make was I couldn't be picky about the work that I took. I was completely sanguine with that at the time.

Really from 28 until 42 that was exactly where I was. The work didn't matter. What mattered was the quality of life in between the gigs. And, of course, keep your tongue in your check and have as much fun as you can while you're doing all the things you have to do and you win. That was my metric.

!# Tim @ 00:42:50

When did that hubris lead to a reckoning? You know when did [Icarus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Icarus) get too close to the sun? When did that change? Why did it change?

!# Mike @ 00:43:00

I don't know why. I mean I could theorize. It happened when my grandfather got sick. He was 92. The guy could build a house without a blueprint. You know, the guy could take my watch apart right now blind folded and put it back together. He had the chip. The chip of knowing I used to call it. He only went to the 7th grade, but he was a master electrician by the time he was 30, a plumber, a mason, a mechanic, a welder, whatever. I idolized him.

By 2001, I was working here in San Francisco, impersonating a host over at Evening Magazine. Working really for CBS News in that capacity. My mother called me to tell me my grandfather was fading. I hung up thinking, "God damnit, I never did anything on television that he would look at and recognize as work." You know. He loved me and he was proud of me, and vice versa, but I never... Imagine the guy I just described seeing his grandson singing opera, selling things in the middle of the night on QVC, flying around the country doing a bullshit TV show for no reason other than mercenary. For him, a guy who built things, repaired things, fixed things, I was just from another universe.

I thought before he goes it would be nice to do something on TV that looked like work. That really started a conversation with my boss about a segment that was called _Somebody's Got to Do It_. That segment ultimately took place in construction sites and factory floors. The first one was me in the sewers of San Francisco, hosting a show called _Evening Magazine_.

It was a hugely important moment because it nearly got me fired.  It did get my boss fired. He was set for early retirement anyway. You know _Evening Magazine_, right?

!# Tim @ 00:45:24

[Yes]

!# Mike @ 00:45:25

You know it's 7 o'clock in the bay area and you sit down for another heart warming story about a 3-legged dog name Mirin whose overcome some sort of canine kidney failure. Instead you get me, crawling through a river of shit. You know. With a sewer inspector. Covered in the worst excrement there is, with rats and roaches and... It was great. And it was horrible. And half the people who called, called to congratulate me, and the other half called demanding my head, which, of course, is exactly what you want in TV.

So, even though it didn't work ultimately on _Evening Magazine_; I did 20 of those segments. Cobbled them together and ultimately sold them to the Discovery Channel and that became _Dirty Jobs_. But it all happened fundamentally because I wanted to put something on TV that wouldn't cause my grandfather to throw his crumbled up National Bohemian Beer can at the screen.

!# Tim @ 00:46:28

If this is not something you can talk about, or don't want to talk about, that is totally fine. I'm just curious when you sold those shows to Discovery, were you able to negotiate back the rights? Or did you have them in the first place? Or how did that work?

!# Mike @ 00:46:42

Yeah, I am kind of simplifying and overstating a little bit. I took Dirty Jobs everywhere and heard "no" in as many ways as a person can hear "no." You know, it was too gross for CBS. It was not gross enough for Fox. Too funny for PBS. Not funny enough for Comedy Central. Around and around we went.

I eventually should the pilot to a guy named [Craig Piligian](http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0683434/), who runs _Pilgrim Films and Television_. He actually owed me a favor, I think, because a couple of years earlier I hosted a complete abortion called _Worst Case Scenario_, which aired on TBS. He produced it and I hosted it. He said, "look, if I can ever help you."

So I gave him this pilot. It was basically a pilot of me collecting semen from a bull called _Hunsucker Commando_. He showed this to Discovery. And Discovery was like, "look, that is weird. It will never work, but let's talk to that guy." Not even knowing that they had hired me ten years earlier in 1993 to host a show called _Romantic Escapes_, which turned out to be neither. But anyway, I often say _Romantic Escapes_ was me and a pretty girl going around the world, creating the illusion of romance in 5 star hotels. From there I worked my way up to the sewer.

!# Tim @ 00:48:09

[Laughs]

!# Mike @ 00:48:10

... And finally got a career started.

!# Tim @ 00:48:12

So this gent that you mentioned. How did he then return the favor?

!# Mike @ 00:48:17

He took the pilot I shot to Discovery and he showed it to them. That opened the conversation about me becoming the Discovery guy. So, I made a deal with Discovery to narrate their ten plus special, and to become a kind of de facto avatar. My whole pitch to Discovery was you don't need another host, and you network doesn't need another expert. The world is full of them. You need a fan. You need a fan of your brand. You need a curious cat to got out into the world and look under the rock with a crew that leaves a light footprint, just to ask the kind of questions I would ask if I were watching TV with my friend from home. That is what you need.

They bought that idea. I said, "can we do Dirty Jobs?" They said, "God no." I said, "why not?" And we had this whole conversation about brand and off brand and everything else.

Eventually, they just said, "look, we'll take 3 hours of it just to put it on to kind of introduce you. What we really want you to do is dive in a submersible with [James Cameron](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Cameron) and go to the Titanic. Then we want you in Sahe Hawask to explore sarcophagus in the largest cemetery recently discovered in North Africa." You know all these cool expeditions.

Then they put Dirty Jobs on the air and we got 10 thousand letters first month. And that was that. But, to answer your question: No, I don't own dirty jobs. I own me. And thankfully Dirty Jobs with Mike Rowe became this thing that ultimately launched 30, 31 other shows. So, I was able, with the help of my partner, a brilliant woman called Mary Sullivan... We were able to take the basic DNA of the show, the basic guts of it that were frankly inspired by my granddad and turn that into a non-profit foundation called [mikeroweWORKS](http://profoundlydisconnected.com/foundation/). And turn that into a completely separate business.

So, while the show was on the air, I was able to start filtering a lot of other opportunities through this other entity. But... sorry I am free associating.
